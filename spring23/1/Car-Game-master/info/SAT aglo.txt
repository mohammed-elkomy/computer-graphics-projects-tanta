Steps:

    1- Find all edges
    2- Get normal vector of these edges
    3- For Each Normal Vector
        1- We need to project all points from two shapes
        2- get min and max from shape 1 
        3- get min ans max from shape 2
        4- There's a gap if (maxB < minA) or (maxA < minB) -->> return False
        5- return True -->> can't find a gap
